## About The Project

In this challenge, you'll build an FAQ accordion. This is an extremely common front-end pattern, so it's an excellent opportunity to get some practice in!

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

This was my first accordion challenge. It was great for practicing using a for loop to iterate through the content containers and then adding the click event to get the desired results.
